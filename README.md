# Titanic Dataset analysis python implementation
This free data came from [kaggle.com “Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster”](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
I followed “Predicting Titanic survivors with machine learning – Ju Liu”
tutorial on YouTube. I added additional display features, and graphs to compare survival by location and age.
The prediction tree provided a great visual display that helped me understand how the code was working and if I wrote my algorithm correctly.  

## Demographics
```
python Demographics.py
```

## General Survival Rates
```
python General_Survival_Rates.py
```

## Survival Variations
```
python Survival_Variations.py
```

## Survival By Gender
```
python Survival_Genders.py
```

## Gender Comparison
```
python Gender_Comparisons.py
```
